About the Summer Training
-------------------------
I was informed about this program by one of my friend. At first i thought to check out how exciting and interesting the program is. I am enjoying being a part of it.I learned a lot for exmple how to send mail correcting, how to use terminal, how to use github account etc.

I am thankful to the mentor for his patience and his time for this training.
